Personally, i spent hours in trying to figure out how some of this plugins work and getting the data and displaying them on the page. \r\n- The biggest problem i faced was to be able to display AJAX data on featherlight popup. \r\n- IFrame for the maps did not show up so i just took a picture of actual map as a place holder, the code is there but could not figure out why it did not show up, tested on gibson. \r\n- I put a lot of effort to style the page but still is not complete!\r\n- The Side navigation is not happy!\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n- [teknepal.com/ist.rit.edu](https://teknepal.com/ist.rit.edu)\r\n- [people.rit.edu/tn2089/ist.rit.edu](https://people.rit.edu/tn2089/ist.rit.edu)\r\n\r\n## Some Cool Stuff\r\n- Click on Accordion to to get more info \r\n- Quote and background color for the research items icons changes everytime we refresh the page.\r\n- Click on staff, faculty and reserch icons to get more info. \r\n\r\n",
