# ist.rit.edu
A ISTE 330 project II to write API based front end website IST department at RIT

- [jquery.prettyPhoto.js](http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/) - “prettyPhoto is a jQuery lightbox clone. Not only does it support images, it also support for videos, flash, YouTube, iframes and ajax. It’s a full blown media lightbox.”

You can animate the color, the x and y offset, the blur-radius and spread radius. Mark Carver contributed code to support rgba colors (the alpha channel) and Jason Redding contributed code to support multiple shadows.
- [jquery-ui.js](https://jqueryui.com) - jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library. Whether you're building highly interactive web applications or you just need to add a date picker to a form control, jQuery UI is the perfect choice.

## Issues
- Given time to complete this project, it was a lot to be done. Personally, i spent hours in trying to figure out how some of this plugins work and getting the data and displaying them on the page. 
- The biggest problem i faced was to be able to display AJAX data on featherlight popup. 
- IFrame for the maps did not show up so i just took a picture of actual map as a place holder, the code is there but could not figure out why it did not show up, tested on gibson. 
- I put a lot of effort to style the page but still is not complete!
- The Side navigation is not happy!
